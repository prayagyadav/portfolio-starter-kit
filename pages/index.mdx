<h2> <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 via-green-500 to-indigo-400 inline-block text-transparent bg-clip-text">Hi! I am Prayag</div></h2>

I'm a final year master of physics student at [University of Hyderabad](https://www.uohyd.ac.in/).
I am interested in experimental particle physics and aim to pursue a phD in the same field.
I have a keen interest in computers and networking. I play chess and make music in my pass time.
