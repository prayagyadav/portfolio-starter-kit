## Hi! I am Prayag
BigTitle

I'm a final year master of physics student at [University of Hyderabad](https://www.uohyd.ac.in/).
I am interested in experimental particle physics and aim to pursue a phD in the same field.
I have a keen interest in computers and networking. I play chess and make music in my pass time.
