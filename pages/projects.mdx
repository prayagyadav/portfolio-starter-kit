__Project Title:__ *“Search for dark matter in the Higgs to two bottom jets channel with large missing transverse energy.”* \
__Supervisor:__ Dr Bhawna Gomber, University of Hyderabad \
__Description:__ 
- Among the many open questions in physics, the question of what Dark Matter is, is a mysterious one.
- In this thesis, I study a specific ‘simplified model’ of dark matter. The simplified model is a supersymmetric
model called the two Higgs doublet model - a (2HDMa). The 2HDMa model introduces a new pseudoscalar ‘a’
which mediates the interaction between the Dark sector (denoted by χ and χ) , and the usual standard model
particles.
- The signal signature is a high missing transverse momentum and a standard model Higgs which decays to
two bottom quarks. These bottom quarks produce particle jets which are identified as ‘b-jets’ using a b-
tagging algorithm.
- The analysis involves the identification of the signal (large pTmiss + H → bb̅ ) from various backgrounds which
are estimated by defining control regions and by Monte-Carlo simulation.
- I use the COFFEA framework (Columnar Object Framework For Effective Analysis) as my analysis tool.
- The analysis is originally going on at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I collaborate with the
Wisconsin’s group to perform control region studies.
- The two major backgrounds for this analysis are top pairs (tt) and Z → νν . These two backgrounds
are estimated by estimating four different control regions: single muon, single electron, double
muon and double electron. Currently I am working on estimating the muon control region.
- My aim is to push the analysis forward by helping with control region estimation.

__Supervisor:__ Dr Bhawna Gomber \
__Duration:__ 20th July 2022 to 4th July 2023 
- Before starting my masters project, I did an internship with the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid)
Group at the University of Hyderabad. I did this in parallel to my coursework classes.
- During this time, I learnt the basics of analysis in experimental HEP.
- I learnt a lot of tools: C++, ROOT, CMSSW, Python, COFFEA, bash scripting and submitting jobs to
dask and HTCondor schedulers.
- I took up the job of setting up and maintaining the newly bought server for my lab. I learnt how to
install RHEL based enterprise Linux on the server, installed ROOT and other HEP relevant software,
deployed containerized solutions to HEP analysis like singularity and docker containers, hosted an
internal Jupyterhub server with containerized backends.
- At the physics analysis part of things, I helped the PhD students with estimation of dielectron
backgrounds in their analyses using ROOT and C++.

__Title:__ 
*‘Study of entanglement of photons in para-positronium decay and its implications’* \
__Supervisor:__ Prof. Rudrajyoti Palit \
__Duration:__ (May 2021 to July 2021) and (Dec 2021 to Jan 2022)
- I did a reading project on the above-mentioned title. I learnt in detail about Gamma-ray spectroscopy
and double Compton scattering cross sections.
- I focused on the use of segmented HPGe detectors to detect the correlation between two entangled
photons produced as a result of a positronium decay (e + + e − ).
- I learnt about the signal processing and data acquisition required for such an analysis. I also learnt
about CZT detectors and NaI (Tl) gamma spectroscopy.
- At the end of my project, my guide posed a problem. The problem was to find the relative
contributions of Compton Scattering and Photoelectric absorption in a full photopeak corresponding
to an E=0.511MeV. I solved the problem by creating a simulation in python from scratch.
