## Master's Thesis

**Project Title:** ‚ÄúBackground Estimation of Mono-Higgs in ùëèùëèÃÖ final state using 2018 data of the CMS detector at the
LHC, CERN‚Äù \
**Supervisor:** Dr Bhawna Gomber, University of Hyderabad \
**Description:**

- Among the many open questions in physics, the question of what Dark Matter is, is a mysterious one.
- In this thesis, I studied a specific 'simplified model' of dark matter. The simplified model is a
    supersymmetric model called the two-Higgs doublet model - a (2HDMa). The 2HDMa model introduces a
    new pseudoscalar 'a', which mediates the interaction between the Dark sector (denoted by $\chi$ and $\bar{\chi}$) and the
    usual standard model particles.
- The signal signature is a high missing transverse momentum and a standard model Higgs which decays to
    two bottom quarks. These bottom quarks produce particle jets which are identified as 'b-jets' using a b-
    tagging algorithm.
- The analysis involves the identification of the signal (large $p_T^{miss} + H\rightarrow b\bar{b} $) from various backgrounds which
    are estimated by defining control regions and by Monte-Carlo simulation.
- I use the **COFFEA framework** (Columnar Object Framework for Effective Analysis) as my analysis tool.
- The analysis is originally going on at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I collaborate with the Wisconsin
    group to perform control region studies.
- The two major backgrounds for this analysis are top pairs ($t\bar{t}$) and $Z\rightarrow \nu\bar{\nu}$.
These two backgrounds are estimated by estimating four different control regions: single muon, single electron,
double muon, and double electron. I have contributed to the estimation of Top muon and Top electron control region studies.

## Internships and other projects

### HSF-India Trainee Project
__Project__: Building examples for Future Circular Collider (FCC) analyses using the Columnar Framework For Effective Analysis (COFFEA)
framework and developing the schema class implementation of FCC simulation samples in COFFEA \
__Mentors__: David Lange (Princeton University), Bhawna Gomber (University of Hyderabad) \
__Duration:__ June 2023 - Ongoing \
__Description:__ : \
The purpose of this project is to build the necessary schema class for FCC simulation samples in COFFEA and create examples of simple
analyses done in COFFEA utilizing FCC simulation samples. The schema classes for the NanoAOD data structure are already present in COFFEA.
Developing a schema class for FCC samples would enable analyses to be performed in Python and take advantage of parallel processing with
less time-to-insight. Based on the existing examples of FCC analyses, COFFEA examples of the same are to be built and documented, which
 will streamline the reproducibility of the results.

### Internship with CMS group at the University of Hyderabad
**Supervisor:** Dr Bhawna Gomber \
**Duration:** 20 th July 2022 to 4 th July 2023
- Before starting my master's project, I did an internship with the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid)
          Group at the University of Hyderabad. I did this in parallel to my coursework classes.
- During this time, I learnt the basics of analysis in experimental HEP.
- I learnt a lot of tools:`C++`, `ROOT`, `CMSSW`, `Python`, `COFFEA`, bash scripting and submitting jobs to
          Dask and HTCondor schedulers.
- I took up the job of setting up and maintaining the newly bought server for my lab. I learnt how to
          install RHEL-based enterprise Linux on the server, installed ROOT and other HEP-relevant software,
          deployed containerized solutions to HEP analysis like singularity and docker containers, and hosted
          an internal Jupyterhub server with containerized backends.
- At the physics analysis part of things, I helped the PhD students with an estimation of Dielectron backgrounds in their analyses using ROOT and C++.

### Project in experimental nuclear physics
**Title:** 'Study of entanglement of photons in para-positronium decay and its implications' \
**Supervisor:** Prof. Rudrajyoti Palit \
**Duration:** (May 202 1 to July 2021) and (Dec 2021 to Jan 2022)
- I did a reading project on the above-mentioned title. I learnt in detail about Gamma-ray spectroscopy
and double Compton scattering cross sections.
- I focused on the use of segmented HPGe detectors to detect the correlation between two entangled
photons produced because of a positronium decay ($e^+ + e^-$).
- I learnt about the signal processing and data acquisition required for such an analysis. I also learnt
about CZT detectors and NaI (Tl) gamma spectroscopy.
- At the end of my project, my guide posed a problem. The problem was to find the relative
contributions of Compton Scattering and Photoelectric absorption in a full photopeak corresponding
to an E=0.511MeV. I solved the problem by creating a simulation in Python from scratch.
